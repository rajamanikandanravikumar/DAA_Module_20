# EX 2D BACKTRACKING - GRAPH COLORING PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To solve the Graph Coloring Problem using backtracking, assigning colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color while minimizing the number of colors used.



## Algorithm
1. Start by assigning the first color to the first vertex.
2. Move to the next vertex and try all available colors.
3. For each color, check if itâ€™s safe 
4. If safe, assign the color and move to the next vertex recursively.
5. If no color works, backtrack to the previous vertex and try a different color.

                color[v] = c 
                
                if self.graph_coloring_util(m, color, v + 1):
                    return True
                
                color[v] = 0

        return False

        color = [0] * self.V 

        if not self.graph_coloring_util(m, color, 0):
            print("Solution does not exist")
            return None

        print("Solution exist and Following are the assigned colours:")
        print(" ".join(map(str, color)))

## Result:
The Graph Coloring program executed successfully, and the colors were assigned to the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
